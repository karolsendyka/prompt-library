# Project Overview

This is a [10x Astro Starter](https://github.com/przeprogramowani/10x-astro-starter) project, a modern web application built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). It's designed to be a starting point for fast, accessible, and AI-friendly websites.

The application is server-side rendered and uses the Astro Node.js adapter to run in a standalone mode.

*   **`npm run dev`**: Starts the development server at `http://localhost:3000`.
*   **`npm run build`**: Builds the application for production.
*   **`npm run preview`**: Previews the production build.
*   **`npm run lint`**: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
*   **`npm run lint:fix`**: Fixes linting issues automatically.
*   **`npm run format`**: Formats the code using Prettier.

## Development Conventions
